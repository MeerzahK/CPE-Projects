# 📋 Cross-Platform Audits

This folder is where I experiment with writing custom scripts that can audit devices across macOS, Windows, and Linux — without relying on heavy tooling.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning Here

- Writing Bash, PowerShell, and Python audit scripts
- Collecting endpoint data like disk encryption, firewall status, etc.
- Exporting results in readable formats (JSON, CSV)
- Automating periodic audit execution and reporting

## 📁 Folder Structure

|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `scripts/`        | Scripts written in Bash, PowerShell, or Python  |
| `output-samples/` | Example outputs from real audit script runs     |

This folder helps simulate real-world endpoint audits — often needed in security compliance or system hardening workflows.

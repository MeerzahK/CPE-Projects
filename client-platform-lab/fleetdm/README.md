# 🛡️ FleetDM Lab

This folder focuses on using [FleetDM](https://fleetdm.com/) to manage and query endpoints across platforms using **osquery**. FleetDM helps centralize endpoint visibility, compliance checks, and live queries in real-time.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning Here

- Setting up FleetDM backend locally (Docker) or on AWS
- Writing custom osquery policies and live queries
- Running queries across macOS, Windows, and Linux endpoints
- Automating inventory collection and CIS compliance checks

This setup simulates how real teams use FleetDM to ensure their endpoints are healthy, compliant, and secure.

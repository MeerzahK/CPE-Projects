# 🧪 Client Platform Lab

This lab is part of my hybrid engineering learning roadmap. It's designed to explore hands-on tools and practices for managing, auditing, and securing client devices across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Deploy FleetDM and use osquery to monitor and query endpoints
- Explore MDM tools like NanoDM and MicroMDM
- Create cross-platform auditing scripts
- Understand real-world endpoint management workflows

# üß™ Client Platform Lab

Welcome! This lab is part of my hands-on learning journey toward becoming a Hybrid Client Platform Engineer. Here, I'm exploring endpoint management tools, testing configurations, and building workflows to better understand how modern IT teams manage devices across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand how open-source tools like FleetDM and osquery work in real-world scenarios
- Learn how to manage macOS devices using MDM solutions like NanoMDM and MicroMDM
- Explore Windows device management with Microsoft Intune and PowerShell
- Practice building policies, queries, and automation that improve endpoint visibility and compliance

This is a learning-first lab ‚Äî expect active experiments, evolving scripts, and work-in-progress documentation.

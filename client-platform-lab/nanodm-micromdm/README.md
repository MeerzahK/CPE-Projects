# 🍏 NanoMDM & MicroMDM Experiments

This lab focuses on learning Apple MDM internals through hands-on use of **NanoMDM** and **MicroMDM** — open-source MDM servers for macOS.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning Here

- Creating and deploying macOS MDM configuration profiles
- Running a local MDM server with NanoDM or MicroMDM
- Understanding APNs, device enrollment, and push mechanics
- Building and testing declarative MDM workflows

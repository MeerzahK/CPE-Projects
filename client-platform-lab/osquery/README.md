# 🧠 osquery Toolkit

This folder explores the raw power of **osquery**, the open-source agent that powers tools like FleetDM. It allows querying your system like a database.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning Here

- Writing osquery query packs for different use cases
- Building custom osquery extensions (in Python or Go)
- Running standalone osqueryd on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Creating scripts to automate query pack deployment

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder       | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `packs/`     | Predefined packs of related queries for auditing   |
| `extensions/`| Custom plugins for extending osquery functionality |

This is where I tinker directly with osquery — writing and testing packs, collecting forensic data, and experimenting with security use cases.

# 🧠 Hybrid Engineer Project Portfolio

Welcome to the **Hybrid Engineer Project** folder — a curated portfolio combining **DevOps Engineering** and **IT Client Platform Engineering**.

This structure is designed to showcase our **learning journey** as we explore tools, workflows, and best practices in building modern, secure, and automated environments.

## 🧪 Ongoing Learning & Contribution

This is an evolving space meant to reflect continuous growth. As we explore new technologies, frameworks, and automation strategies, **new folders will be added** to document hands-on experimentation and implementation.

Each project is meant to:
- Reinforce practical knowledge
- Serve as a testbed for new tools
- Document learning milestones
- Build a portfolio that aligns with hybrid roles in DevOps and IT platform engineering

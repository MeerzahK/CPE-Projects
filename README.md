# 👨‍💻 Hybrid Client Platform Engineering & DevOps Roadmap

Welcome! This repository documents my journey into building a **hybrid skillset** that combines:

🎯 **Client Platform Engineering** (macOS, Windows, Linux)  
🛠️ **DevOps & Automation** (Terraform, CI/CD, GitHub Actions)  
☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS-first deployments)

This is a hands-on learning roadmap where I’m actively creating real-world systems to better understand how modern IT and DevOps work together to deliver secure, automated, and scalable endpoint environments.

## 📦 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repo represents a focused area of my hybrid learning roadmap.

### 🔍 `client-platform-lab/`

> **Purpose:** Build visibility, control, and policy enforcement across endpoints.

- Experiments with **FleetDM**, **osquery**, and live querying
- Hands-on with **NanoMDM** / **MicroMDM** for Apple device management
- Profiles for **CIS compliance**, inventory tracking, and system hardening

### ⚙️ `devops-infra/`

> **Purpose:** Automate infrastructure and manage lifecycle with DevOps tools.

- Infrastructure-as-Code using **Terraform** (with AWS)
- GitHub Actions for **CI/CD pipelines** to test, deploy, and validate configurations
- Docker-based local dev + testing environments

### 🛠️ `self-healing-scripts/`

> **Purpose:** Learn scripting by solving real-world problems automatically.

- Scripts to detect and fix misconfigurations or non-compliance
- Focused on **macOS bash**, **PowerShell**, and **Linux shell**
- Self-remediation for disk space, agent health, MDM profile drift, etc.

### 🗂️ `docs/`

> **Purpose:** Document architecture, decisions, experiments, and lessons learned.

- `diagrams/` – Visuals showing workflows, infrastructure, and system maps
- `how-it-works/` – Technical deep-dives (e.g., MDM flows, CI/CD concepts)
- `notes/` – Journal of findings, issues, solutions, and iterations
- `planning/` – Personal roadmap, backlog, and future goals

## 🚧 Current Focus

📌 **Phase 1 – Client Platform Lab**  
Working on endpoint audit and compliance engine using FleetDM, osquery, and macOS MDM tools.  
Goal: Full lifecycle visibility from provisioning to compliance enforcement.

## 📈 Learning Principles

- 🧠 Learn by doing — build real tools for real problems  
- 🧪 Iterate often — improve based on feedback and break/fix cycles  
- 🔍 Document everything — mistakes, breakthroughs, and decisions
